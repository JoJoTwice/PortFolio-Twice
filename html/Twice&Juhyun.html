        <h1>How I became a Twice's TOP Fan</h1>
        <hr/>
        <p>I am not the top fan of Twice, but I have the mindset of a topfan. Twice debuted in 2015 with their title strong
            called OOH! AH! It is a very catchy song and it was the most replayed song to date on a music streaming platform called "Melon"
        <p>2015 is also the year i graduated from college. It took me about 6 years to graduate. I basically ignored the course requirements and kept
            taking classes that interested me. If it weren't a public school, the tuition would have been unbearable.

            <h2>Twice and V live</h2>
            <p>Nayeon is the oldest member of Twice. She was born in 1995 and her nickname is the elder youngest or in Korean Mott Ne.
                There is this platform called V-Live which was created by Naver. It was way for me to communicate with Twice on a streaming platform. 
            The members would skim through 10,000 of comments that are uploaded on live and respond to the ones they can read and intrigues them. 
            It is a lucrative platform that provides not only a live streaming service but also to purchase merchandise get emojis and stuff </p>
