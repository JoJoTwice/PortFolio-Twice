    <p class="eduParagraphEdit">
        I started my hig school year in the states and struggled a lot at first.
        Growing up later part of my life in a predominantly Asian neighborhood, 
        where you can get by without speaking a word of English, made it harder
        for me to get used to speak, read, and write English.
        Now, I have a undergraduate and graduate degree and getting my second 
        graduate degree. My second graduate degree was not planned. It was 
        a way for me to fill the time gap I had between the deployment and Officer 
        Leadership Course and pursue my intrest in international relations.

            Military has been a big part of my life. That is how I attained
            my citizenship and made a life lasting friends whom I would have
            never encountered in my civilian life. The military life finally
            made me feel like I am an American. A big part of the skillset 
            and knowledge I have is from the military as well as my
            interest in internatoinal relations and economics
