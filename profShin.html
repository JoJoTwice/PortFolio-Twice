    <p class="profSummary">
        As an immigrant, my initial career goal was to work for immigrant youth in 
        the states psychologically, emotionally, financially, and physically. I dedicated
        earlier years of my exprience during college by participating in Korean American Civic
        Empowerment. There are limited resources avaible to undocumented youth and if there were,
        they are not usually accessibel to the immigrants. I was one of those undocumented and
        I watned to contribute myself for the community that knows no other home than the United States.
        My career path had bumps and some successes along the way with working for Asian immigrants
        in navigating public resources to finding jobs and working for the city government to integrate
        minoritized communities and the elected officials in bringing awareness and the knoweldge of
        resources that all residents of the New York city are entitled to.

        <p class="conclusion">
            You might wonder why attend a bootcamp, if my career goal is to work of immigrant youth.
            It is a skillset I wanted to obtain and I came across the opportunities to be certified
            as a junior software developer and programming is becoming of part of every job. From policy
            development to data anaylsis, researchers and program managers are using stata, r, and python.
            Knowning how the programs work and having the skillset to create a webserver is a nichie.
            Also, it can be a skillset which I can use as an alternative income resource.
