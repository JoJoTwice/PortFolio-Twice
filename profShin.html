    <p class="profSummary">
        As an immigrant, my initial career goal was to work for immigrant youth in 
        the states. I dedicated  earlier years of my exprience during college by participating in 
        Korean American Civic Empowerment. There are limited resources avaible to undocumented youth and 
        if there were, they are not usually accessible to immigrants. I was one of those undocumented 
        and I watned to contribute myself for the community that knows no other home than the United States.
        My career path had bumps and some successes along the way with working for Asian immigrants
        in navigating public resources to finding jobs and working for the city government to integrate
        minoritized communities and the elected officials in bringing awareness and the knoweldge of
        resources that all residents of the New York city are entitled to.

        <p class="conclusion">
            You might wonder why I attend a bootcamp, if my career goal is to work of immigrant youth.
            I have two reasons: It was an alternative route I took for being taken off the deployment. 
            I needed to buy some time for rent and applying for jobs. 
            Another reason is it is a skillset I wanted to obtain. I came across the opportunities to be certified
            as a junior software developer and programming is becoming a big part of every job. From policy
            development to data anaylsis, researchers and program managers are using stata, r, and python.
            Knowning how the programs work and having the skillset to create a webserver is a nichie.
            Also, it can be a skillset which I can use as an alternative income resource.
