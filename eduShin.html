    <p class="eduParagraphEdit">
        I started my higschool year in the states and struggled a lot at first.
        Growing up later part of my life in a predominantly Asian neighborhood, 
        where you can get by without speaking a word of English, made it harder
        for me to get used to speak, read, and write English.
        Now, I have a undergraduate and graduate degree and getting my second 
        graduate degree. My second graduate degree was not planned. It was 
        a way for me to fill the time I had between the deployment and Officer 
        Leadership Course and pursue my intrest in international relations.

            Military has been a big part of my life. That is how I attained
            my citizenship and made life lasting friends whom I would have
            never encountered in my civilian life. A big part of the 
            skillset and knowledge I have is from the military as well as my
            interest in internatoinal relations
